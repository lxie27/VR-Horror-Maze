## VR Horror Maze
Hack for HackRU Fall 2019

## Inspiration
Coming in as a Computer Science and Game Development major, I wanted to get something out of this hackathon that would be useful to me afterwards - in addition to it being spooky season as of release.

## What it does
It's a VR maze horror game! Use the left thumbstick on a controller to move, using the headset to rotate with.

## How I built it
It's all done in Unity3D with the Oculus Rift/Xbox One controller.

## Challenges I ran into
Setting up VR in Unity was easier than expected - getting a solid set of controls was hard. There's a common paradigm to not do any movements on a VR-player that they aren't inputting themselves, which I learned was harder to implement successfully than I had thought.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I think I created a pretty solid atmosphere in the short amount of time and experience I have in UX. Also, I got way more of my design document done than I thought.

## What I learned
Scope small. 

## What's next for VR-Horror-Maze
Small bug fixes, more maps, better AI, perhaps players can counterplay?

## How do I run it?
Download the Build folder, and run HackRUF19.exe (works on Windows)
